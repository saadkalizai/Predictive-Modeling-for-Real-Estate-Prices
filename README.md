Welcome to the "Predictive Modeling for Real Estate Prices" project repository! This project leverages machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for real estate prices based on key features such as 'Neighborhood,' 'Bedrooms,' and 'Bathrooms.' The project aims to provide valuable insights into property pricing, enabling informed decision-making in the real estate domain.
